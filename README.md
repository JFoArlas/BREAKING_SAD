Analysis of a beer [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravharamkar/beer-data-analytics) consisting of beer features and reviews.

Questions to explore:
- Overthrowing beer snobbery: This dataset indicates that there are 104 different ways of brewing a beer (column x has 104 different beer types). Can our machine learning algorithm ‘taste’ beer better than the experts?
- Can we predict beer style based on the features in this dataset?
- Can our model predict which beers are most enjoyable based on the features in this dataset?
- How does ABV affect overall scores?
- Predict which what 5 beers will continue to get the highest rating
- Group beers by ABV, Brewer, Style, and Brand to see what impacts this has on reviews
- Group by reviewID to see if certain reviewers are showing biased
- Identify positive and negative reviewers to see if they are outliers or swaying overall scores
