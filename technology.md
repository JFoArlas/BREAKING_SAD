# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
We intend to store the data in S3 and pull it into Postgres.

## Machine Learning
We'll be utilizing the SciKitLearn library and we're deciding between using several different supervised and unsupervised ML models and tools to answer each of our questions:
- Elbow curve and k-means cluster
- Decision tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient booster
- SMOTE/SMOTEENN

## Dashboard
We will integrate Tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
